<center><p><font color="white"><h2 style="font-family:monospace;"> Our stance on the Illegal Music Download Dilemma is as students we belive that it is not anything bad, or should be considered stealing. In fact, when an artist puts something out onto the internet tht should already be aware that these things will happen to them. Also, music artist put songs out on the internet so that we can listen to them, and even if we are listening to the music "illegally" the music was still put out there so we could listen to it. Illegal or not. </h2></font></p></center>
